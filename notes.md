**Notes**

1. Qualifer: 
   1. it can be used to define which bean to autowire. It is mentioned at the place of autowiring with the bean name
   and also where the bean wasa created.
2. If multiple beans are present, then primary is given preference. If yuou want to select a specific bean, use Qualifier.
3. Dependency Injection:
   4. Constructor -> no need to write autowrire. for rest you to write it.
   5. Setter
   6. field 
4. ComponentScan: Tells Spring where to search beans which will be injected as a dependency.
5. Dependency injection: process of findind right beans , wiring them to the class.
6. All beans get initialized in starting of SPring application and then autowiring takes place.
   But we can use @LAZY annotation to delay the intialisation but it is generally not recemonded as
   as it delays startup issue to production issue.
7. Scope types
   - Scope annotation is used to create a Singleton (one bean per Spring IOC continer) or Prototype.
     For protoype, everytime a new bean is created whenever the bean is accessed by context.
8. POstContruct() - Runs in the bean where it is present After all dependecies are injected.
9. PreDestory() - Runs just before the bean is destroyed by Spring container. Used to release resources.
10. In Java EE it offered XML based configuration where every bean had to be defined in XML without
    any annotations, which was a bit difficult to maintain, hence we moved a ahead with Annotations.

### SPRING BOOT ###

1. Provides all of the dependencies in starter project so configuration is easy.
2. Hence starting the application becomes very easy with Spring.
3. Auto-Configuration
   - ClassPath
     - We import classes using the import staement. But The JVM needs to exactly know where
       is the class present, so it doesn't has search in entire project.
   - AutoConfiguration is used to configure to default configurations which makes starting of application easy.
     - Eg. DispatvcherCong, ErrorResponseConfig.
4. SpringBoot profile is used to configure different cofiguration in different environments. You can create files
    such as application-dev.properties, application-prod.properties. In the default file, which is application.properties,
    set profile as spring.profile.env and spring will merge application.properties and the respective env property file.
5. Spring Actuator is a starter which gives important metrics like requests per second, thread pool size, all beans etc.

## Spring Boot and DB ##

1. SPring JDBC was earlier used to connect to db. JDBCTemplate was used to hardcode queries in code and update/search in db.
2. JPA -> Java Persistance API. Just make the class as Entity and use Entity Manager in repository to access data. No need
    to manually write queires.
3. Spring JPA -> No need of entitiy Manager. just extend JAPRepository and the quries are formed 
on the fly by the library.

## Web Services in SPring ##
 <p> Initially there was not a concept of a separate UI/frontend as most sites were static. Hence
    provided JSP(Java Server Pages). It provides a view which is basically whole HTML page to browser
    whenever a request is made. Some important annotations
    - Controller
    - @RequestMapping("path")
    - @RequestParam - QueryParam
    - @ResponseBody - when you don't want to return a view, return Body as is. 
</p>

<p> Logging is important aspect. You can set log level for a specific package too. Usually SFL4J 
is used for logging i.e LoggingFactory with is a transient dependency of spring-web</p>

## DispatcherServlet

- MVC model stnnds for Model, View, Controller. First Request comes to a front controller called
  dispatcher servlet. From there it is routed to COntroller, then a model is assigned to it and in
the end a View is assigned (JSP).

## Headers
- Accept-header is used to tell what format client expects the data. If server can serve it then well and good.
- Accept-language
